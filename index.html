<p>My name is Alan Durham and I am a teacher with Charlotte Mecklenburg Schools.  I teach English to 9th and 11th grade students now, but I have also taught elementary aged students in South Korea.  I lived there for fifteen months and I have also traveled to 11 other countries. Now I am learning web development in a coding bootcamp through UNCC</p>
